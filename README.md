# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview
Display earthquake maps with multiple map layer options and tectonic plates defined and the earthquake overlay. The markers show earthquake locations on the earth and earthquake magnitude. 

## Technologies Used
  - JavaScript
  - Leaflet.js
  - geoJSON
  - HTML
  - CSS

### Earthquakes Maps
Each screenshot below shows a different selection of options between the layers and overlays to choose from. Notice the earthquake magnitude legend color scale in the lower right hand corner.

#### Earthquakes Challenge
All options selected.

### Summary
I actually liked this challenge, it was an interesting subject to cover (who's not interested in earthquakes). I have a much better understanding of how to apply geoJSON maps
